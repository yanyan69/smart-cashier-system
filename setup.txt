SMART BUSINESS CASHIER AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Installation and Setup Guide
(Windows Operating System with XAMPP)

This document provides a complete step-by-step procedure for installing and configuring the system on a local Windows environment using XAMPP. The process is designed for users with minimal technical experience.

Prerequisites

Microsoft Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit recommended)

XAMPP (Apache + MySQL + PHP) – latest version
Download: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Select the installer for PHP 8.2 or 8.3

Step 1: Install XAMPP

Run the downloaded XAMPP installer.

Install to the default location: C:\xampp

Make sure Apache and MySQL are selected.

Finish the installation.

Step 2: Obtain the Project Source Code

Recommended Method (Git Clone):

Open Command Prompt or Windows Terminal.

Run the following commands:

cd C:\xampp\htdocs
git clone https://github.com/yanyan69/smart-cashier-system.git

Alternative Method (Manual Download):

Go to https://github.com/yanyan69/smart-cashier-system

Click "Code" then "Download ZIP"

Extract all files into C:\xampp\htdocs\smart-cashier-system

Step 3: Run the Automated Setup (Highly Recommended)

Open the folder: C:\xampp\htdocs\smart-cashier-system

Double-click the file named setup.bat

Wait 10–30 seconds for the process to complete.

The setup.bat script will automatically:

Pull the latest code from GitHub (if Git is installed)

Copy all files to the correct location

Start Apache and MySQL services

Create the database named cashier_db

Import the database schema from database.sql

Open the system in your default web browser

Step 4: Initial System Access (After setup.bat finishes)

The browser will open: http://localhost/smart-cashier-system/

On the login page, click "Register here."

Fill in the registration form:
Username: admin (or any preferred name)
Password: choose a strong password
Role: admin (required for full access)

Click Register

Log in using your new credentials.

You now have full administrative access to the system.

Updating the System in the Future

To update the system safely without losing data, run setup.bat again.

Access from Mobile Devices (Same Wi-Fi Network)

On the Windows PC, open Command Prompt and type: ipconfig

Find the "IPv4 Address" (example: 192.168.1.100)

On any device connected to the same Wi-Fi, open a browser and visit:
http://192.168.1.100/smart-cashier-system/

The system is now fully installed, configured, and ready for daily use.
